# React_Counter_Component_SSI
Created with CodeSandbox.
Build a counter component that meets the following features:
1. Display current count at the top
2. the row under current count should contain two buttons side by
side, Increment and Decrement buttons,
which will increase/decrease the count by 1 per click
3. the row under Inc/Dec row should contain two buttons side by
side, Increment-If-Odd and Async-Inc buttons,
which will increase the current count by 1
only if the current count is odd number (Increment-If-Odd)
after a second delay upon the click (Async-Inc)
*4. another new row contains a timer-add-button
The button displays "Start" initially
upon clicking it will start increasing the counter by 1 per
second and displays "Stop"
clicking again will stop the increase and switch the button text
to "Start"
